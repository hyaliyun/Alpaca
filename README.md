🦙🛁 Cleaned Alpaca Dataset
This repository hosts a cleaned and curated version of the dataset used to train the Alpaca LLM. On April 8, 2023, ~50,000 uncurated instructions were replaced with GPT-4-LLM data. Curation is ongoing.

7B and 13B LoRA models (trained in April 2023) are available on Hugging Face:

7B Model
13B Model
High-quality data improves model performance, often more effectively than increasing model size.

🧹 Data Cleaning and Curation
The original GPT-3-generated dataset had issues like noise, bias, and poor loss curves. The cleaned version addresses these, improving performance and reducing hallucinations.

Key Issues Fixed:

Noisy and inconsistent data.
US-centric bias.
Over-reliance on GPT-3 limitations.
