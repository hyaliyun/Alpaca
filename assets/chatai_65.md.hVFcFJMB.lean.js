Cost Dynamics: The cost of renewable energy technologies is decreasing over time, making them more competitive, whereas the extraction and production costs for non-renewable energy can fluctuate significantly based on market demand and geopolitical factors."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the paragraph to improve its clarity and readability.","input":"Despite the fact that many students struggle with their assignments and studies for various reasons, such as a lack of time or understanding of the material, it is essential that they seek help from their teachers or peers in order to achieve success in their academic endeavors.","output":"Many students struggle with their assignments and studies for various reasons, such as time constraints or difficulty understanding the material.
