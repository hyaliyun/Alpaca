The cost of renewable energy technologies is decreasing, whereas non-renewable energy prices can be volatile based on market conditions."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.input.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.output.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function G(i,e,o,d,s,r){const p=g("PoemCard");return n(),a("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"ü§îAI Effective Techniques Collectionüß†")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=c=>s.searchQuery=c),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[y,s.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(n(!0),a(b,null,v(r.filteredPoems,(c,m)=>(n(),w(p,{key:m,poem:c},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(n(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...c)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...c))},[s.isLoading?(n(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(n(),a("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):k("",!0)])}const F=h(j,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-1e355c4c"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/58.md","filePath":"quotes/58.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/58.md"},N=Object.assign(H,{setup(i){return(e,o)=>(n(),a("div",null,[T(F)]))}});export{O as __pageData,N as default};
